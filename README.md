# MIDI-for-Video
Plot MIDI CSV for video

Included Dean Town folder with all the individual MIDI .csv and their respective graphs. Separated by folders as that was the easier way with my current setup.

I'll upload the MIDI to CSV Lua script for Reaper soon although you can probably make one in Python.

Step 2 is using some video libraries for generating video with the script using a tempo + metric or a grid.
